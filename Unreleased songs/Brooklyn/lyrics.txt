[Intro]
Welcome to the Exhibition.
Please do not touch the artists... they are very fragile.

[Verse 1]
Sitting in the basement, guarding the gate
Talking 'bout the struggle, talking 'bout fate
You got the vintage filter, you got the look
Reading from the same old dusty book
"Analog warmth" just to hide the cold
Selling a story that’s already sold
You think the scratch on the record is "Art"
But it’s just the sound of a stopping heart.

[Pre-Chorus]
You’re scared of the edge, so you round it off
You hear the machine and you start to scoff
But while you were polishing a rusty crown
I built a cathedral in the center of town.

[Chorus]
Welcome to the Museum!
Where nothing ever changes, nothing is new
Just a hollow cage for the chosen few!
You call it "Soul," I call it a grave
You’re not a rebel, you’re just a slave—
To the loop! To the box! To the gallery wall!
I’m the Architect watching the Gentry fall!
WATCH THE GENTRY FALL!

[Verse 2]
Let’s talk power, let’s talk facts
You hide your range in the reverb tracks
You play in circles, safe and slow
That’s why your melody has nowhere to go
You’re terrified of the fire, scared of the shift
Stuck on the ground, missing the lift
You want the "Vibe" but you can’t pay the price
Rolling the same old weighted dice.

[Bridge]
You fought the future.
You fought the code.
And while you were screaming... the Labels reload.
They took your sound.
They bought your street.
Now you’re just a ghost on a corporate beat.

[Final Chorus]
Welcome to the Museum!
Where nothing ever changes, nothing is new
Just a hollow cage for the chosen few!
You call it "Soul," I call it a grave
You’re not a rebel, you’re just a slave!
Burn the gallery! Break the wall!
I’m the Architect watching the Gentry fall!

[Outro]
Compare the harvest.
The Museum is closed!
