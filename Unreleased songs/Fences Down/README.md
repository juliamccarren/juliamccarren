# Fences Down

## 📖 Story

If you are young you still don't know the burden of life. This song is pure vitality and freedom. It's the rebellion against the ancestors. In a metaphorical sense it is my plea for the evolution of music. Give all your have. Give your soul. Give your voice. Don't let others dictate your art.
