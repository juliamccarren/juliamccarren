[Verse 1]
I used to live in a house made of glass
Watching the seasons and the polite people pass
Keep the shirt tucked in, keep the heartbeat slow
Walking the lines where they tell you to go
But you crashed in like a gale force wind
Smashing the windows and soaking my skin
Now the roof is gone and the sky is gray
And I wouldn’t have it any other way.

[Pre-Chorus]
Rip up the map, throw the compass in the dirt
I want the adrenaline, I want the hurt
Of feeling something real, something raw like this
A forest fire hidden in a single kiss.

[Chorus]
Let it run wild, let it run deep
It’s a promise that the civilized just can’t keep
We are the wolves at the edge of the town
We are the sound of the fences falling down
It’s untamed, baby, it’s off the chain
Dancing barefoot in the freezing rain
I don’t want the safety, I don’t want the mild
Give me the untamed, give me the wild.

[Verse 2]
They say we’re dangerous, they say we’re a mess
Two loaded guns in a wedding dress
But I’d rather burn out bright and fast
Than sit in the corner and make it last
You taste like copper, you taste like sparks
We’re navigating solely by the darks
No gravity here, just the pull of the blood
Drag me through the river, drag me through the mud.

[Pre-Chorus]
Cut the brakes, let the engine scream
Wake me up from the American dream
I want the friction, I want the bliss
Of a cliff-edge moment just like this.

[Chorus]
Let it run wild, let it run deep
It’s a promise that the civilized just can’t keep
We are the wolves at the edge of the town
We are the sound of the fences falling down
It’s untamed, baby, it’s off the chain
Dancing barefoot in the freezing rain
I don’t want the safety, I don’t want the mild
Give me the untamed, give me the wild.

[Bridge]
Let the neighbors talk
Let the sirens wail
We’re writing our own
Twisted fairy tale
No logic here
No rules apply
Just you and me
And the open sky...
AND THE OPEN SKY!

[Chorus]
Let it run wild, let it run deep
It’s a promise that the civilized just can’t keep
We are the wolves at the edge of the town
We are the sound of the fences falling down
It’s untamed, baby, it’s off the chain
Dancing barefoot in the freezing rain
I don’t want the safety, I don’t want the mild
Give me the untamed, give me the wild.

[Outro]
Yeah, give me the wild.
Tear the fences down.
Let 'em watch us burn.
Wild.
Untamed.
