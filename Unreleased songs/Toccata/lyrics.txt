[Intro]
Toccare... Toccare...

[Verse 1]
The melody is dark, the rhythm is a pulse
My fingers on the keyboard, nothing else.
It started with a whisper, a gentle invitation,
Now it's a deep vibration, pure sensation.
I trace the lines, I feel the charge, the static air,
A silent promise hanging there, a desperate prayer.
This darkness that surrounds us, it only makes it clearer,
I need to pull you closer, [Italian] ti voglio più vicina.

[Prechorus]
[English]
No hesitation now, just pure electrical flow,
I need to feel it now, I need to let it go.
I want to breach the distance, the space between the beat,
Ready for the moment, feel the heat!
Tocca me, baby!

[Chorus]
Don't break the moment, don't stop the sound, 
Lost in the rhythm, turning 'round and 'round. 
I’ve got you where I want you, right here in the dark, 
You are the music leaving its mark! 
Sei Toccata!

[Verse 2]
My skin is buzzing, like the speakers in the floor,
This energy you give me, I'm craving something more.
You don't need to speak, the language is in the hands,
Following the motion, following your commands.
[Italian] Sento il tuo respiro, [English] I feel your breath upon my neck,
Breaking every boundary, ignoring every check.
Let the rhythm guide us through this dark, hypnotic haze,
Lost in the fire of these electric ways.

[Prechorus]
There’s no turning back, the spell is cast tonight,
Give me that connection, with all your heat and light.
I want to close the circuit, the gap is getting small,
Ready for the moment, give your all!
Tocca me, baby!

[Chorus]
Don't break the moment, don't stop the sound, 
Lost in the rhythm, turning 'round and 'round. 
I’ve got you where I want you, right here in the dark, 
You are the music leaving its mark! 
[Italian]
Sei Toccata!

[Bridge]
Toccami piano...
[English]
The history, the feeling, the darkness of the sound.
From the organ's pipes to the speakers on the ground.
[Italian]
Toccami forte...
[English]
A thousand years of music, now pulsing through the air.
The feeling is electric, a touch beyond compare.

[Chorus]
Don't break the moment, don't stop the sound, 
Lost in the rhythm, turning 'round and 'round. 
I’ve got you where I want you, right here in the dark, 
You are the music leaving its mark! 
[Italian]
Sei Toccata!

[Outro]
Sì, Toccata...
