[Verse 1]
There’s a bench by the oak tree where the sidewalk ends
I watch them sit down like two best friends
He takes a handkerchief out of his vest
Dusts off the wood so her coat doesn't mess
She laughs a sound like dry leaves in the wind
He smiles at a joke that’s deep under his skin
They aren't saying much, they don't need the words
Just watching the people and feeding the birds.

[Pre-Chorus]
And here we are, racing the sun down the street
Burning on adrenaline and skipping a beat
Terrified that silence means something is wrong
Wondering if we’re gonna last quite that long.

[Chorus]
’Cause we are the fireworks, loud and bright
But they are the candle that lasts through the night
We are the hurricane, crashing and fast
They are the shelter built to last
I don’t want a love that just burns out the dark
I want the embers, not just the spark
Oh, baby, look at them, then look at me
That’s who I want us to be.

[Verse 2]
I saw her fixing the collar of his shirt
With hands that have seen all the joy and the hurt
He offered his arm when it was time to go
Moving through molasses, steady and slow
You squeezed my hand tight when we walked on by
Like you were afraid I might float to the sky
But looking at them, I’m learning the truth
That romance is more than just wasted on youth.

[Chorus]
’Cause we are the fireworks, loud and bright
But they are the candle that lasts through the night
We are the hurricane, crashing and fast
They are the shelter built to last
I don’t want a love that just burns out the dark
I want the embers, not just the spark
Oh, baby, look at them, then look at me
That’s who I want us to be.

[Bridge]
It’s not about never getting bored or old
It’s having a hand that you still want to hold
When the skin gets thin and the memories fade
It’s about honoring the mess that you made
Together.

[Outro]
He opens the car door, she slides inside
Fifty years later, she’s still his bride
I look at you, and I squeeze back tight
I think we can make it through the night.
Yeah, I want the embers...
Not just the spark
Let’s be the embers.
