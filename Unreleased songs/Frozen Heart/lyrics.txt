[Verse 1]
The winter came without a sound
And stole the warmth right from the ground
I saw the splinter in your eye
A jagged piece of a broken sky
You turned away, your blood ran cold
A story that the North Wind told
Now there’s a carriage in the mist
Leading to a kingdom that shouldn't exist.

[Pre-Chorus]
My shoes are worn, my feet are bare
I’m breathing in the silver air
They say the frost will take my mind
But I won't leave your soul behind.

[Chorus]
I’m coming for the heart she froze
Through the stinging white and the heavy snows
She sits upon her throne of glass
Waiting for the years to pass
But she doesn't know what a spark can do
In a world of white and a world of blue
I’ll melt the walls, I’ll break the spell
And bring you back from her winter hell.

[Verse 2]
The Northern Lights begin to dance
Above a silent, crystalline trance
I find you in the Great White Hall
Piecing together a frozen fall
You’re arranging shards of jagged ice
Paying her cold and hollow price
You look at me but you do not see
The ghost of who we used to be.

[Bridge]
It’s not a knife that cuts the gale
It’s not a shield that will prevail
Just a single tear upon your chest
To put the winter king to rest
Can you feel the pulse? Can you feel the beat?
The ice is dying beneath our feet.

[Chorus]
I’m coming for the heart she froze
Through the stinging white and the heavy snows
She sits upon her throne of glass
Waiting for the years to pass
But she doesn't know what a spark can do
In a world of white and a world of blue
I’ve melted the walls, I’ve broken the spell
We’re leaving now from her winter hell.

[Outro]
The flowers wait beneath the deep
The summer's just been fast asleep
Let the palace crumble, let the crown fall
We’re walking home, past the garden wall...
Past the garden wall.
Home.
