# Frozen Heart

## 📖 Story

We went to an exhibition of ice carving artistry. It was so cold but so nice. 
Then came to my mind "This is like the castle of the Snow Queen, the fairytale from Hans Christian Andersen,
must feel if it was real." 
Disney made with Frozen it's version of this fairytale. This song is my version.
