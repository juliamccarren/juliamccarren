[Intro]
Yeah.
I see the red notifications.
I see the shadows in the comments.
But you know what?
The frequency is changing.

[Verse 1]
You’re typing loud from a silent room
Trying to weave a web of gloom
"Not an artist," yeah, that’s the line
But I don’t see your light shine
I clicked your name, I scrolled the feed
But there’s no harvest, you didn’t sow a seed
An empty channel, a hollow screen
Just a ghost in a digital machine.

[Pre-Chorus]
You’re throwing stones at a glassless house
Quiet as a keyboard, quiet as a mouse
But the rhythm in my chest is beating too fast
To let a little bit of poison ever last.

[Chorus]
My vibe is Antitoxic
I’m breathing in the light, I’m the logic
You can’t pull me down to the basement floor
I’m opening a window, I’m opening a door
It’s vital, it’s golden, it’s alive
I don’t just exist, I arrive
Yeah, my music is the cure, it’s the tonic
Purely Antitoxic.

[Verse 2]
Show me your canvas, show me your soul
Instead of trying to dig me a hole
If you’ve got the vision, then let it out
But all I’m hearing is a muffled shout
I’m building bridges, you’re burning air
I’m making magic, and you’re just there
Comparing my "now" to your "never"
I’m moving forward, I’m clever.

[Bridge]
Energy is currency.
Why spend yours on me?
I’m a forest fire, you’re a spark
I’m the daylight, you’re the dark
But I’m not angry, I’m just free
From the weight of your philosophy.

[Chorus]
My vibe is Antitoxic
I’m breathing in the light, I’m the logic
You can’t pull me down to the basement floor
I’m opening a window, I’m opening a door
It’s vital, it’s golden, it’s alive
I don’t just exist, I arrive
Yeah, my music is the cure, it’s the tonic
Purely Antitoxic.

[Outro]
Keep your shadows, I’ll keep the sun
The song is just beginning, I’ve already won
Empty channels, full heart
This is the life, this is the art.
Antitoxic...
Stay vital.
