# Antitoxic

## 📖 Story

I got a lot of attacks from people on the socials for using AI assistance. Then I asked them to show me their art. But there was nothing. When you look at their channels they are empty. Destruction is always easier than construction. I don't know if I should be upset or rather feel sorry for them. What I know is, that those people have venom in their blood. And it may harm themselves when they do not pay attention to their lives. As I am a very vital positive person I don't long for their company. I am Antitoxic.
