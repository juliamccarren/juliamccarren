    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    
<p class="text-standard">

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
The winter came without a sound<br>
And stole the warmth right from the ground<br>
I saw the splinter in your eye<br>
A jagged piece of a broken sky<br>
You turned away, your blood ran cold<br>
A story that the North Wind told<br>
Now there’s a carriage in the mist<br>
Leading to a kingdom that shouldn't exist.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
My shoes are worn, my feet are bare<br>
I’m breathing in the silver air<br>
They say the frost will take my mind<br>
But I won't leave your soul behind.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
I’m coming for the heart she froze<br>
Through the stinging white and the heavy snows<br>
She sits upon her throne of glass<br>
Waiting for the years to pass<br>
But she doesn't know what a spark can do<br>
In a world of white and a world of blue<br>
I’ll melt the walls, I’ll break the spell<br>
And bring you back from her winter hell.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
The Northern Lights begin to dance<br>
Above a silent, crystalline trance<br>
I find you in the Great White Hall<br>
Piecing together a frozen fall<br>
You’re arranging shards of jagged ice<br>
Paying her cold and hollow price<br>
You look at me but you do not see<br>
The ghost of who we used to be.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
It’s not a knife that cuts the gale<br>
It’s not a shield that will prevail<br>
Just a single tear upon your chest<br>
To put the winter king to rest<br>
Can you feel the pulse? Can you feel the beat?<br>
The ice is dying beneath our feet.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Instrumental Break]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
I’m coming for the heart she froze<br>
Through the stinging white and the heavy snows<br>
She sits upon her throne of glass<br>
Waiting for the years to pass<br>
But she doesn't know what a spark can do<br>
In a world of white and a world of blue<br>
I’ve melted the walls, I’ve broken the spell<br>
We’re leaving now from her winter hell.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
The flowers wait beneath the deep<br>
The summer's just been fast asleep<br>
Let the palace crumble, let the crown fall<br>
We’re walking home, past the garden wall...<br>
Past the garden wall.<br>
Home.<br>
