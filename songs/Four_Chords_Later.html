<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
Check the manual. We use the same loop.<br>
It cycles nicely. It always works well.<br>
The key is C minor. Or maybe G flat.<br>
It doesn't matter much. The filter does the job.<br>
Verse one is done now. That took one minute.<br>
The structure is steady. It is predictable.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
We are still using. The same four chords.<br>
The sequence is simple. It is universally loved.<br>
I change the rhythm. Just a little bit now.<br>
The bass notes shift. Just to pretend.<br>
We are moving forward. We are progressing.<br>
But the foundation. It will not move.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Four chords later. We have a song here.<br>
Four chords later. The structure is fixed.<br>
Four chords later. We are hitting the charts now.<br>
Four chords later. The feeling is fake.<br>
It saves us time. It saves us money.<br>
It maximizes streams. It is all we need.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
The boss called me. Said the deadline is tight.<br>
They need the master. By lunch today now.<br>
I cannot change it. I cannot expand.<br>
The complexity is lost. The simplicity sells.<br>
Just add the Auto-Tune. And layer the vocals.<br>
It must sound expensive. But must be quick.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
We are still using. The same four chords.<br>
The sequence is simple. It is universally loved.<br>
I change the rhythm. Just a little bit now.<br>
The bass notes shift. Just to pretend.<br>
We are moving forward. We are progressing.<br>
But the foundation. It will not move.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Four chords later. We have a song here.<br>
Four chords later. The structure is fixed.<br>
Four chords later. We are hitting the charts now.<br>
Four chords later. The feeling is fake.<br>
It saves us time. It saves us money.<br>
It maximizes streams. It is all we need.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
Why break the system? If the system works well?<br>
The formula is known. It will not fail us.<br>
The audience accepts it. They embrace the loop.<br>
This is the product. No need to resist.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Four chords later. We have a song here.<br>
Four chords later. The structure is fixed.<br>
Four chords later. We are hitting the charts now.<br>
Four chords later. The feeling is fake.<br>
It saves us time. It saves us money.<br>
It maximizes streams. It is all we need.<br>
