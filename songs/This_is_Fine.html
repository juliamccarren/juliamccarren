<strong>[0:00 - 0:25 - Section A: Introduction - Spoken/Whispered, heavy reverb, very slow]</strong><br>
Listen now.<br>
Just the pads.<br>
Hold the note.<br>
This is the moment.<br>
The moment to breathe.<br>
<br>
<strong>[0:25 - 0:50 - Section B: The Loop - Sung, flat monotone]</strong><br>
This is fine.<br>
We are resting now.<br>
This is fine.<br>
We are resting now.<br>
The emotion is handled.<br>
By the sound of the reverb.<br>
<br>
<strong>[0:50 - 1:15 - Section C: Descriptive Narration, very slow tempo]</strong><br>
The loop is eight seconds.<br>
It repeats softly.<br>
It adds to the minute count.<br>
No need for singing now.<br>
The structure is simple.<br>
It must be simple here.<br>
<br>
<strong>[1:15 - 1:40 - Section B Repeat: The Loop - Sung, flat monotone]</strong><br>
This is fine.<br>
We are resting now.<br>
This is fine.<br>
We are resting now.<br>
The emotion is handled.<br>
By the sound of the reverb.<br>
<br>
<strong>[1:40 - 2:05 - Section D: The Padded Runtime - Whispered, slightly distorted/filtered]</strong><br>
We are still here.<br>
You are still listening.<br>
The time keeps moving.<br>
The song keeps playing.<br>
It needs to reach three minutes.<br>
For the streaming numbers.<br>
It needs the full length.<br>
<br>
<strong>[2:05 - 2:30 - Section B Repeat: The Loop - Sung, flat monotone, slightly louder]</strong><br>
This is fine.<br>
We are resting now.<br>
This is fine.<br>
We are resting now.<br>
The emotion is handled.<br>
By the sound of the reverb.<br>
<br>
<strong>[2:30 - 2:50 - Section E: Minimal Change]</strong><br>
The chords shift slightly.<br>
Just for a moment.<br>
Now they return back.<br>
To the main sequence.<br>
We showed a difference.<br>
We satisfied the listener.<br>
<br>
<strong>[2:50 - 3:00 - Outro - Spoken/Whispered, fading out, heavy delay]</strong><br>
The three minutes are done.<br>
The track is ending now.<br>
That was easy.<br>
Total time elapsed...<br>
Moving on now.<br>
This is fine.<br>
