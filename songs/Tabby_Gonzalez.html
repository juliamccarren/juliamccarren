<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
Woke up this mornin' to a sound, a little meow and a purr<br>
Yeah, my feline friend, she's Tabby G, she's the one I prefer<br>
Got a streak of white right down her nose, a tabby coat so fine<br>
And when she gives that little head nudge, she blows my mind<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Oh, Tabby Gonzalez, yeah, she's the queen of the house<br>
Moves like a ninja, quiet as a mouse<br>
She'll tear up the couch, she'll knock down your vase<br>
But you can't be mad at that sweet, furry face<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
She's got a swagger when she walks, a little hip in her sway<br>
A cardboard box is a palace, where she'll spend her day<br>
She's a hunter in the kitchen, a lion on the floor<br>
And when that can of tuna pops, she'll ask for more<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Oh, Tabby Gonzalez, yeah, she's the queen of the house<br>
Moves like a ninja, quiet as a mouse<br>
She'll tear up the couch, she'll knock down your vase<br>
But you can't be mad at that sweet, furry face<br>
<br>
<strong>[Guitar Solo]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
She'll be sleeping in the sunshine, she'll be twitchin' in her dreams<br>
You might think she's a diva, but she's not what she seems<br>
'Cause when the day is done, and the world is still and calm<br>
She'll curl up on my lap, safe and sound from all harm<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
Tabby G! Oh, Tabby Gonzalez!<br>
Yeah, Tabby G!<br>
... Wait, where'd she go?<br>
