<strong>[Intro]</strong><br>
Toccare... Toccare...<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
The melody is dark, the rhythm is a pulse<br>
My fingers on the keyboard, nothing else.<br>
It started with a whisper, a gentle invitation,<br>
Now it's a deep vibration, pure sensation.<br>
I trace the lines, I feel the charge, the static air,<br>
A silent promise hanging there, a desperate prayer.<br>
This darkness that surrounds us, it only makes it clearer,<br>
I need to pull you closer, ti voglio più vicina.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Prechorus]</strong><br>
No hesitation now, just pure electrical flow,<br>
I need to feel it now, I need to let it go.<br>
I want to breach the distance, the space between the beat,<br>
Ready for the moment, feel the heat!<br>
Tocca me, baby!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Don't break the moment, don't stop the sound,<br>
Lost in the rhythm, turning 'round and 'round.<br>
I’ve got you where I want you, right here in the dark,<br>
You are the music leaving its mark!<br>
Sei Toccata!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
My skin is buzzing, like the speakers in the floor,<br>
This energy you give me, I'm craving something more.<br>
You don't need to speak, the language is in the hands,<br>
Following the motion, following your commands.<br>
Sento il tuo respiro, I feel your breath upon my neck,<br>
Breaking every boundary, ignoring every check.<br>
Let the rhythm guide us through this dark, hypnotic haze,<br>
Lost in the fire of these electric ways.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Prechorus]</strong><br>
There’s no turning back, the spell is cast tonight,<br>
Give me that connection, with all your heat and light.<br>
I want to close the circuit, the gap is getting small,<br>
Ready for the moment, give your all!<br>
Tocca me, baby!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Don't break the moment, don't stop the sound,<br> 
Lost in the rhythm, turning 'round and 'round. <br>
I’ve got you where I want you, right here in the dark,<br> 
You are the music leaving its mark!<br>
Sei Toccata!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
Toccami piano...<br>
The history, the feeling, the darkness of the sound.<br>
From the organ's pipes to the speakers on the ground.<br>
Toccami forte...<br>
A thousand years of music, now pulsing through the air.<br>
The feeling is electric, a touch beyond compare.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Don't break the moment, don't stop the sound, <br>
Lost in the rhythm, turning 'round and 'round.<br> 
I’ve got you where I want you, right here in the dark,<br> 
You are the music leaving its mark! <br>
Sei Toccata!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
Sì, Toccata...<br>
