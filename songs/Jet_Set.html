<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
The 4:00 AM alarm is a hollow sound<br>
A cold static echo in a silent house<br>
Suitcase by the door, heavy as a stone<br>
While the rest of the world is dreaming on their own.<br>
6:00 AM departure, Gate B-24<br>
I don’t think I can find the magic in the sky anymore<br>
Just the smell of jet fuel and the taste of bitter tea<br>
Wondering who this version of me is supposed to be.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
They call it the high life, they say that I’m blessed<br>
But I’m just a ghost in a suit, failing the test<br>
Of staying connected while I’m drifting away<br>
In the blue-grey light of a breaking day.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus 1]</strong><br>
Oh, it’s a long way down from the jetset height<br>
Just me and the dash-lights in the middle of the night<br>
Driving a rental on a nameless freeway<br>
Chasing a tomorrow that feels just like today.<br>
Give me a rug and a slow-burning spark<br>
Instead of these headlines and the cold and the dark<br>
Yeah, the gold-plated life is a lonely design<br>
When I’m just longing for home and your hand in mine.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
The hotel room is perfect, sterile and white<br>
With a view of a city I won’t see by light<br>
Dinner for one from a plastic tray<br>
Watching a sitcom from three years away.<br>
The silence is heavy, it rings in my ears<br>
It’s been the same wallpaper for five hundred years<br>
A thousand miles south of where I should be<br>
Locked in a tower by the side of the sea.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
The reflectors on the asphalt are a rhythm in the rain<br>
A steady heartbeat for a different kind of pain<br>
I’m over the clouds but I’m under the weather<br>
Trying to hold all these zip codes together.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Guitar Solo]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus 2]</strong><br>
It’s a five-star view of an empty street<br>
Counting the hours till we finally meet<br>
The frequent flyer miles don’t make up the cost<br>
Of every sunset and every moment I’ve lost.<br>
I’d trade the sky for a seat by the fire<br>
To put out the flame of this endless desire<br>
To just be still, to just be known<br>
Beyond the terminal and the dial-tone.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
Forget the miles, forget the points<br>
Forget the ache in my tired joints.<br>
Just light the fire, let the cedar smoke rise<br>
I want to see the reflection of home in your eyes.<br>
Yeah, turn off the lights...<br>
No more 4:00 AM flights.<br>
Just home.<br>
