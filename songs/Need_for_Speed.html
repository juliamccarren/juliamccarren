    <h1>Lyrics</h1>

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
Got my keys in my hand, a rusty old wheel
Engine coughs to life, a low, guttural squeal
The paint's peeling off, got a dent in the side
The passenger seat's where the squirrels like to hide
They laugh when I tell 'em my car's a machine
A beautiful, beat-up, mechanical queen

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
She ain't pretty, no, she ain't got the gleam
Just a four-wheeled bucket living out a fast dream
'Cause the needle's a-climbin' past 85 miles
Leaving all the fancy cars in a cloud of dust smiles
Yeah, the road is my canvas, the asphalt my friend
I'll drive this old wreck 'til the very end

<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
The windows are stuck and the heater is broke
Been pulled over twice 'cause of all of the smoke
The radio's shot, just static and noise
But I've got my own music, my own roaring voice
A symphony of metal, a rattle and bang
That's the anthem I sing, the song that I sang

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
She ain't pretty, no, she ain't got the gleam
Just a four-wheeled bucket living out a fast dream
'Cause the needle's a-climbin' past 85 miles
Leaving all the fancy cars in a cloud of dust smiles
Yeah, the road is my canvas, the asphalt my friend
I'll drive this old wreck 'til the very end

<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
They can talk about chrome and the leather so soft
The price tags are high and the payments a loft
But my freedom is cheap, no fancy expense
Just a full tank of gas and a lack of common sense

<strong>[Guitar Solo]</strong>

<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
She ain't pretty, no, she ain't got the gleam
Just a four-wheeled bucket living out a fast dream
'Cause the needle's a-climbin' past 85 miles
Leaving all the fancy cars in a cloud of dust smiles
Yeah, the road is my canvas, the asphalt my friend
I'll drive this old wreck 'til the very end

<strong>[Outro]</strong>
Yeah, I'll drive this old wreck,
Yeah, I'll drive this old wreck,
'Til the wheels fall off!
And then I'll find another one...
