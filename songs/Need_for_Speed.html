<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
Got my keys in my hand, a rusty old wheel<br>
Engine coughs to life, a low, guttural squeal<br>
The paint's peeling off, got a dent in the side<br>
The passenger seat's where the squirrels like to hide<br>
They laugh when I tell 'em my car's a machine<br>
A beautiful, beat-up, mechanical queen<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
She ain't pretty, no, she ain't got the gleam<br>
Just a four-wheeled bucket living out a fast dream<br>
'Cause the needle's a-climbin' past 85 miles<br>
Leaving all the fancy cars in a cloud of dust smiles<br>
Yeah, the road is my canvas, the asphalt my friend<br>
I'll drive this old wreck 'til the very end<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
The windows are stuck and the heater is broke<br>
Been pulled over twice 'cause of all of the smoke<br>
The radio's shot, just static and noise<br>
But I've got my own music, my own roaring voice<br>
A symphony of metal, a rattle and bang<br>
That's the anthem I sing, the song that I sang<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
She ain't pretty, no, she ain't got the gleam<br>
Just a four-wheeled bucket living out a fast dream<br>
'Cause the needle's a-climbin' past 85 miles<br>
Leaving all the fancy cars in a cloud of dust smiles<br>
Yeah, the road is my canvas, the asphalt my friend<br>
I'll drive this old wreck 'til the very end<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
They can talk about chrome and the leather so soft<br>
The price tags are high and the payments a loft<br>
But my freedom is cheap, no fancy expense<br>
Just a full tank of gas and a lack of common sense<br>
<br>
<strong>[Guitar Solo]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
She ain't pretty, no, she ain't got the gleam<br>
Just a four-wheeled bucket living out a fast dream<br>
'Cause the needle's a-climbin' past 85 miles<br>
Leaving all the fancy cars in a cloud of dust smiles<br>
Yeah, the road is my canvas, the asphalt my friend<br>
I'll drive this old wreck 'til the very end<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
Yeah, I'll drive this old wreck,<br>
Yeah, I'll drive this old wreck,<br>
'Til the wheels fall off!<br>
And then I'll find another one...<br>
