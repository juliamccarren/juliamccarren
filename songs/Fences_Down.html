<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
I used to live in a house made of glass<br>
Watching the seasons and the polite people pass<br>
Keep the shirt tucked in, keep the heartbeat slow<br>
Walking the lines where they tell you to go<br>
But you crashed in like a gale force wind<br>
Smashing the windows and soaking my skin<br>
Now the roof is gone and the sky is gray<br>
And I wouldn’t have it any other way.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
Rip up the map, throw the compass in the dirt<br>
I want the adrenaline, I want the hurt<br>
Of feeling something real, something raw like this<br>
A forest fire hidden in a single kiss.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Let it run wild, let it run deep<br>
It’s a promise that the civilized just can’t keep<br>
We are the wolves at the edge of the town<br>
We are the sound of the fences falling down<br>
It’s untamed, baby, it’s off the chain<br>
Dancing barefoot in the freezing rain<br>
I don’t want the safety, I don’t want the mild<br>
Give me the untamed, give me the wild.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
They say we’re dangerous, they say we’re a mess<br>
Two loaded guns in a wedding dress<br>
But I’d rather burn out bright and fast<br>
Than sit in the corner and make it last<br>
You taste like copper, you taste like sparks<br>
We’re navigating solely by the darks<br>
No gravity here, just the pull of the blood<br>
Drag me through the river, drag me through the mud.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
Cut the brakes, let the engine scream<br>
Wake me up from the American dream<br>
I want the friction, I want the bliss<br>
Of a cliff-edge moment just like this.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Let it run wild, let it run deep<br>
It’s a promise that the civilized just can’t keep<br>
We are the wolves at the edge of the town<br>
We are the sound of the fences falling down<br>
It’s untamed, baby, it’s off the chain<br>
Dancing barefoot in the freezing rain<br>
I don’t want the safety, I don’t want the mild<br>
Give me the untamed, give me the wild.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
Let the neighbors talk<br>
Let the sirens wail<br>
We’re writing our own<br>
Twisted fairy tale<br>
No logic here<br>
No rules apply<br>
Just you and me<br>
And the open sky...<br>
AND THE OPEN SKY!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Guitar Solo]</strong>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Let it run wild, let it run deep<br>
It’s a promise that the civilized just can’t keep<br>
We are the wolves at the edge of the town<br>
We are the sound of the fences falling down<br>
It’s untamed, baby, it’s off the chain<br>
Dancing barefoot in the freezing rain<br>
I don’t want the safety, I don’t want the mild<br>
Give me the untamed, give me the wild.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
Yeah, give me the wild.<br>
Tear the fences down.<br>
Let 'em watch us burn.<br>
Wild.<br>
Untamed.<br>
