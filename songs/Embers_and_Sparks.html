<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
There’s a bench by the oak tree where the sidewalk ends<br>
I watch them sit down like two best friends<br>
He takes a handkerchief out of his vest<br>
Dusts off the wood so her coat doesn't mess<br>
She laughs a sound like dry leaves in the wind<br>
He smiles at a joke that’s deep under his skin<br>
They aren't saying much, they don't need the words<br>
Just watching the people and feeding the birds.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
And here we are, racing the sun down the street<br>
Burning on adrenaline and skipping a beat<br>
Terrified that silence means something is wrong<br>
Wondering if we’re gonna last quite that long.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
’Cause we are the fireworks, loud and bright<br>
But they are the candle that lasts through the night<br>
We are the hurricane, crashing and fast<br>
They are the shelter built to last<br>
I don’t want a love that just burns out the dark<br>
I want the embers, not just the spark<br>
Oh, baby, look at them, then look at me<br>
That’s who I want us to be.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
I saw her fixing the collar of his shirt<br>
With hands that have seen all the joy and the hurt<br>
He offered his arm when it was time to go<br>
Moving through molasses, steady and slow<br>
You squeezed my hand tight when we walked on by<br>
Like you were afraid I might float to the sky<br>
But looking at them, I’m learning the truth<br>
That romance is more than just wasted on youth.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
’Cause we are the fireworks, loud and bright<br>
But they are the candle that lasts through the night<br>
We are the hurricane, crashing and fast<br>
They are the shelter built to last<br>
I don’t want a love that just burns out the dark<br>
I want the embers, not just the spark<br>
Oh, baby, look at them, then look at me<br>
That’s who I want us to be.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
It’s not about never getting bored or old<br>
It’s having a hand that you still want to hold<br>
When the skin gets thin and the memories fade<br>
It’s about honoring the mess that you made<br>
Together.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Instrumental Break]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
He opens the car door, she slides inside<br>
Fifty years later, she’s still his bride<br>
I look at you, and I squeeze back tight<br>
I think we can make it through the night.<br>
Yeah, I want the embers...<br>
Not just the spark<br>
Let’s be the embers.<br>
