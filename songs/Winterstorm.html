    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    
<p class="text-standard">

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
The salt is thick on the driveway, white against the grey<br>
You’re moving through the kitchen in that practiced, quiet way<br>
I’m watching how the pilot light flickers in the draft<br>
While you’re measuring the coffee grounds like an ancient, heavy craft.<br>
The windows hum a little when the North wind hits the glass<br>
We’re just huddling in the kitchen, waiting for the front to pass.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus 1]</strong><br>
But it’s a dry kind of winter, the kind that cracks the skin<br>
And I can’t tell if the ice is out there, or if it’s settled in<br>
We’re keeping up the furnace, we’re burning through the wood<br>
But we’re shivering in a house where the insulation’s good.<br>
Yeah, the sky is turning violet, and the roads are closing down<br>
But it’s been a long December since a fire was found.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
You used to be my woodsmoke, you used to be the thaw<br>
Now you’re just the jagged edge of everything I saw<br>
We’re sleeping ‘neath the heavy quilts, four layers deep at least<br>
But there’s a miles-wide valley between the west side and the east.<br>
I reached out for your shoulder, just to see if you were real<br>
You just tightened up the fabric, like a lock against the steel.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Guitar solo]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
The power lines are sagging, crying under all that weight<br>
It’s funny how a little frost can decide a person's fate.<br>
Do we wait for April? Do we wait for things to bloom?<br>
Or are we just two statues in a temporary room?<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus 2]</strong><br>
Yeah, it’s a cruel kind of winter, and it’s right here in the hall<br>
And the way we’re acting "civil" is the coldest part of all.<br>
We’re checking all the gaskets, we’re taping up the seams<br>
But the frost is moving inward, past the pipes and through our dreams.<br>
Now the driveway’s buried over, and the salt has all run out<br>
And I’ve forgotten what it’s like to live without the doubt.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
The plow is on the main road, I can hear the distant scrape<br>
But there isn’t any shovel that can help us with this shape.<br>
<br>
Just the white noise.<br>
Just the white out.<br>
Stay cold, then.<br>
