<strong>[Intro]</strong><br>
Welcome to the Exhibition.<br>
Please do not touch the artists... they are very fragile.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
Sitting in the basement, guarding the gate<br>
Talking 'bout the struggle, talking 'bout fate<br>
You got the vintage filter, you got the look<br>
Reading from the same old dusty book<br>
"Analog warmth" just to hide the cold<br>
Selling a story that’s already sold<br>
You think the scratch on the record is "Art"<br>
But it’s just the sound of a stopping heart.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
You’re scared of the edge, so you round it off<br>
You hear the machine and you start to scoff<br>
But while you were polishing a rusty crown<br>
I built a cathedral in the center of town.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Welcome to the Museum!<br>
Where nothing ever changes, nothing is new<br>
Just a hollow cage for the chosen few!<br>
You call it "Soul," I call it a grave<br>
You’re not a rebel, you’re just a slave—<br>
To the loop! To the box! To the gallery wall!<br>
I’m the Architect watching the Gentry fall!<br>
WATCH THE GENTRY FALL!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
Let’s talk power, let’s talk facts<br>
You hide your range in the reverb tracks<br>
You play in circles, safe and slow<br>
That’s why your melody has nowhere to go<br>
You’re terrified of the fire, scared of the shif<br>
Stuck on the ground, missing the lift<br>
You want the "Vibe" but you can’t pay the price<br>
Rolling the same old weighted dice.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
You fought the future.<br>
You fought the code.<br>
And while you were screaming... the Labels reload.<br>
They took your sound.<br>
They bought your street.<br>
Now you’re just a ghost on a corporate beat.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Guitar Solo]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Welcome to the Museum!<br>
Where nothing ever changes, nothing is new<br>
Just a hollow cage for the chosen few!<br>
You call it "Soul," I call it a grave<br>
You’re not a rebel, you’re just a slave!<br>
Burn the gallery! Break the wall!<br>
I’m the Architect watching the Gentry fall!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
Compare the harvest.<br>
The Museum is closed!<br>
