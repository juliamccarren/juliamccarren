<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
The heater’s been blowing nothing but clutched-up dust<br>
Now we’re just two shadows in a blur of white and grey.<br>
I can’t see the hood, let alone the road<br>
And you haven’t found a single word to say.<br>
The windshield’s frosting over from the inside out<br>
A crystal map of everything we’re living without.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
We’re caught in the whiteout, losing the line<br>
Between where you end and the ice begins to climb.<br>
I’m shivering in the seat, reaching for the ghost<br>
Of that girl—the one who used to laugh at how the snow tasted.<br>
But now the air is thin and the engine’s gone cold<br>
And we’re just a story that’s been left out in the snow.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
I close my eyes and I can see my father’s porch<br>
The yellow light spilling out across the lawn<br>
I remember how the radiator used to hiss and torch<br>
The winter chill until the ache was gone.<br>
Back then, "home" was a feeling, a heavy wool rug<br>
A kitchen that held me in a permanent hug.<br>
Now I’m staring at your profile in the dashboard glow<br>
Wondering how we got buried under all this snow.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
You’re spinning the tires, making that high-pitched whine in the slush<br>
We’re sinking down, and the world is getting lush.<br>
You’re just counting the cracks in the steering wheel<br>
While you say, "Wait for the morning, the plow will come through,"<br>
But the morning feels like a different lifetime with you.<br>
I’d trade this whole silence for a spark or a flame<br>
But you don’t even whisper the syllables of my name.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Guitar Solo]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
I’m homesick for a house that doesn't exist anymore.<br>
Just a girl by a fireplace, safe behind the door.<br>
The windows are rattling.<br>
The sky is turning lead.<br>
We’re freezing in the silence of the things we never said.<br>
just snow...<br>
Nothing but snow...<br>
