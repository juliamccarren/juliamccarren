<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
It started with a hairline fracture<br>
A word you didn't say, a look I couldn't catch<br>
We’ve been living on this incline for a season<br>
Waiting for the gravity to match<br>
The air is getting thin, the sky is turning slate<br>
I feel the shiver in the shelf beneath my feet<br>
They say the silence is the loudest right before<br>
The white-out makes the burial complete.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
One cold breath, one heavy step<br>
The kind of secrets that we shouldn’t have kept<br>
The pressure's building till the crystals break<br>
How much weight can one heartbeat take?<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
And it’s an Avalanche<br>
Coming down to claim the valley of us<br>
Turning every vow we made into dust<br>
You can’t outrun it, you can’t scream for air<br>
It’s beautiful and breathless and it’s everywhere<br>
We’re going under, frozen in the dance<br>
Buried in the hollow of this avalanche.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
They’ll find us in a thousand years<br>
Locked in this position, static in the blue<br>
I used to fear the cold until I realized<br>
The coldest part of winter was wanting you<br>
There’s a power in the way we fall apart<br>
A kinetic rush that shadows out the sun<br>
Now the house is gone, the map is erased<br>
And there’s nowhere left for us to run.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
It’s not a flood, it’s not a fire<br>
It’s a mountain losing its entire<br>
Weight upon our shoulders, white and blind<br>
Leaving everything we knew behind<br>
Don't fight the slide, don't try to rise<br>
Just look at me with those ice-crag eyes.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Guitar Solo]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Yeah, it’s an Avalanche<br>
Coming down to claim the valley of us<br>
Turning every vow we made into dust<br>
You can’t outrun it, you can’t scream for air<br>
It’s beautiful and breathless and it’s everywhere<br>
We’re going under, frozen in the dance<br>
Buried in the hollow of this avalanche.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
The snow is settling now...<br>
Everything is quiet.<br>
Everything is white.<br>
Just you and me...<br>
Under the weight.<br>
Under the white.<br>
