<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
Another Tuesday, another fight<br>
You leave the door and slam it shut with all your might<br>
I'm standing here, my heart is pounding in my ears<br>
And for a moment, I could drown in all these years<br>
Of misunderstandings, of biting words we throw<br>
It's just the way it's been since we were small, you know<br>
We're oil and water, sun and bitter, stormy rain<br>
One second it's a laugh, the next it's just a pain<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
'Cause I can't stand your presence, and I love you from my heart<br>
It's a twisted, tangled mess right from the very start<br>
We push and pull, we break and bend, we say we're through<br>
But a part of me is always and forever you<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
The phone rings late, you're crying on the other end<br>
And all the anger just dissolves, my oldest friend<br>
I'm in my car before I even think it through<br>
There's no one else on earth I'd rather rush to, but you<br>
We sit in silence on the sofa for a while<br>
And all it takes is just a little, broken smile<br>
For all the hurt to fade, like footprints in the sand<br>
We don't need words to finally understand<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
'Cause I can't stand your presence, and I love you from my heart<br>
It's a twisted, tangled mess right from the very start<br>
We push and pull, we break and bend, we say we're through<br>
But a part of me is always and forever you<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
They say we're mirrors of each other's darkest sides<br>
The one who knows exactly where the other hides<br>
The secrets and the fears we'd never tell a soul<br>
You're half of me that makes the other half feel whole<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
'Cause I can't stand your presence, and I love you from my heart<br>
It's a twisted, tangled mess right from the very start<br>
We push and pull, we break and bend, we say we're through<br>
But a part of me is always and forever you!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
Yeah, a part of me is always and forever you<br>
Through every fight and every single thing we do<br>
The one I love, the one I sometimes can't stand<br>
The girl who'll always be the sister of my hand.<br>
