<strong>[Intro]</strong><br>
School's out! Whoo!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
The weight is lifted, the syllabus torn<br>
This is the very first day that we're truly born<br>
I feel the sunlight cutting through the old haze<br>
Trading in the textbooks for the open road days<br>
No more formulas, no more required reading<br>
Just a wild heartbeat, and a life worth leading<br>
The air is different, it tastes like sweet release<br>
A ticket to anywhere, a brand new lease!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
We stood at the junction, felt the pressure and the heat<br>
Now the engine's running, tapping out a brand new beat<br>
The rearview mirror shows the history gone<br>
'Cause the next great story is the one we're standing upon!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
OH, THE HORIZON LINE HIGH! Yeah, we're climbing the view!<br>
Got that electric fire in everything we do!<br>
Leave the past behind, chasing down the gold rush<br>
The future is calling, and it's worth the rush!<br>
Every single star is lining up for me<br>
This is the sound of pure possibility!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
Used to dream in whispers, hiding under the desk<br>
Now we're shouting the plans, putting joy to the test<br>
The world is a canvas, and we're holding the brush<br>
Painting bright colours in the absolute hush<br>
Of the morning calm, before the daily race starts<br>
We got the power and the fire in our hungry hearts<br>
Forget the failures, forget the small slips<br>
Got big ideas rolling right off our lips!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
We stood at the junction, felt the pressure and the heat<br>
Now the engine's running, tapping out a brand new beat<br>
The rearview mirror shows the history gone<br>
'Cause the next great story is the one we're standing upon!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
OH, THE HORIZON LINE HIGH! Yeah, we're climbing the view!<br>
Got that electric fire in everything we do!<br>
Leave the past behind, chasing down the gold rush<br>
The future is calling, and it's worth the rush!<br>
Every single star is lining up for me<br>
This is the sound of pure possibility!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Rap]</strong><br>
Check the mic, one-two, yeah, the dial is set to max<br>
Used to chase the answers on those laminated facts<br>
Now the goal is freedom, the currency is soul<br>
Taking zero shortcuts, heading straight for the goal!<br>
See the world spinning? We're about to jump in<br>
No more permission slips, no second guessing, we begin!<br>
Got the blueprint drawn, got the mindset tight and clean<br>
This ain't a finish line, fam, it's a starting scene!<br>
From the classroom chatter to the engine's roar and hum<br>
We made it through the fire, now watch the future come!<br>
Yeah!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Guitar Solo]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
OH, THE HORIZON LINE HIGH! Yeah, we're climbing the view!<br>
Got that electric fire in everything we do!<br>
Leave the past behind, chasing down the gold rush<br>
The future is calling, and it's worth the rush!<br>
Every single star is lining up for me<br>
This is the sound of pure possibility!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
POSSIBILITY!<br>
Feel that good vibe!<br>
We are ready!<br>
Horizon Line High!<br>
