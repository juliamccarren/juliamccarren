<p class="text-standard">
<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
We shared the same coffee, the same morning air<br>
I trusted your shadow, I thought you’d be there<br>
Through the nights I was working, lost in the climb<br>
I thought you were cheering, not just biding your time.<br>
But I saw how you looked in that silk, paper-thin<br>
A dress built for silence, to let the world in<br>
And I saw how he folded, how quickly he fell<br>
For a story so shallow even you couldn't tell.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
I was building a future, you were tearing a seam<br>
You traded a lifetime for a flickering gleam.<br>
It’s a heavy-heart lesson, a bitter-sweet song<br>
To realize the person I loved was just wrong.<br>
You can keep the attention, the glances, the lace<br>
But you’ll never fill up all the emptiness in his face<br>
I’m walking away with my head in the light<br>
Because I’m far too much for a man this slight.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
I spent my life learning the weight of a thought<br>
While you practiced the angles of things to be bought.<br>
You gave him the glitter, the easy, the brief<br>
And he took it like water, a common-born thief.<br>
I used to think value was something we grew<br>
But he’s looking for mirrors, and he found one in you.<br>
Go on, wear the outfit that says what you lack<br>
I’m finally leaving, and I’m not looking back.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
It’s funny how clearly the patterns emerge<br>
When the lies and the loyalty finally diverge.<br>
I’m not broken or bitter, I’m just seeing the truth<br>
I wasted my wisdom on the ghost of his youth.<br>
He wanted a surface, a flicker, a spark<br>
While I was the fire that held back the dark.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
I was building a future, you were tearing a seam<br>
You traded a lifetime for a flickering gleam.<br>
It’s a heavy-heart lesson, a bitter-sweet song<br>
To realize the person I loved was just wrong.<br>
You can keep the attention, the glances, the lace<br>
But you’ll never fill up all the emptiness in his face<br>
I’m walking away with my head in the light<br>
Because I’m far too much for a man this slight.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
I’m packing my mind and I’m clearing the shelf<br>
I’m finally back to just being myself.<br>
I don’t need to fix what was broken so long<br>
His preferences, truly, were always set wrong.<br>
Yeah, they were always set wrong.<br>
Goodbye to the shallow.<br>
Goodbye to you both.<br>
