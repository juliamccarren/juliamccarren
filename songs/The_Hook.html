<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
Drums just dropped. The kick is here.<br>
Bass line works. It is standard now.<br>
The vocal is low. It sounds intimate.<br>
We are building tension. This is the plan.<br>
Synth pad is rising. It must be loud.<br>
Wait for the signal. The verse must end.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
I hear the hi-hats. They are getting faster.<br>
I know what happens. You know it too.<br>
The music is changing. It's climbing high.<br>
It must climb higher. Before the release.<br>
I have a feeling. It is manufactured.<br>
You must feel it now. You must feel it soon.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
The Hook Is Coming. Get ready for impact.<br>
The Hook Is Coming. This is the climax now.<br>
The Hook Is Coming. The melody is simple.<br>
The Hook Is Coming. It's designed to stick.<br>
I'm singing louder. The backing vocals hit.<br>
You will remember this. You will repeat it.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
The energy drops. But only a bit.<br>
We must sustain this. For radio play.<br>
The chords are the same. They did not change.<br>
New vocal inflection. To sound fresh now.<br>
The listener is back. They are still here.<br>
They are waiting again. For the next part.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
I hear the hi-hats. They are getting faster.<br>
I know what happens. You know it too.<br>
The music is changing. It's climbing high.<br>
It must climb higher. Before the release.<br>
I have a feeling. It is manufactured.<br>
You must feel it now. You must feel it soon.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
The Hook Is Coming. Get ready for impact.<br>
The Hook Is Coming. This is the climax now.<br>
The Hook Is Coming. The melody is simple.<br>
The Hook Is Coming. It's designed to stick.<br>
I'm singing louder. The backing vocals hit.<br>
You will remember this. You will repeat it.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
Eight bar breakdown. Just the instrumental.<br>
We need a pause now. To reset the ear.<br>
Reverb is heavy. The bass is deep.<br>
The engineer says. This will peak well.<br>
Now we return. The moment is done.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
The Hook Is Coming. Get ready for impact.<br>
The Hook Is Coming. This is the climax now.<br>
The Hook Is Coming. The melody is simple.<br>
The Hook Is Coming. It's designed to stick.<br>
I'm singing louder. The backing vocals hit.<br>
You will remember this. You will repeat it.<br>
