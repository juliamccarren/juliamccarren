<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
I’m talking to the back of your head again<br>
While you’re staring at the screen, counting digital friends<br>
I poured my heart out, laid it on the floor<br>
You didn’t even look up, just pointed at the door<br>
You say I’m "too much," say I’m "acting wild"<br>
Then you pat me on the shoulder like a bitter child<br>
Every word is a needle, every look is a blade<br>
Watching all the promises we ever made just fade.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
And I’m tired of the quiet, tired of the "fine"<br>
Tired of you acting like your soul is worth more than mine<br>
The pressure’s building up, the glass is gonna break<br>
I’ve taken every single hit that I can take.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
So I’m screaming at the walls, I’m screaming at the ghost<br>
Of the man I thought I loved, the one I needed most!<br>
You stripped away my pride and you left me black and blue<br>
Now I’m standing in the wreckage and I’m shouting it at you:<br>
I HATE YOU!<br>
Yeah, I said it, and I mean it tonight<br>
I HATE YOU!<br>
For every time you told me I wasn't right.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
You walk into the kitchen, don’t even say hello<br>
Like I’m just a piece of furniture you happen to know<br>
You laugh at my dreams, call my passions "small"<br>
While you’re standing on a pedestal that’s ten feet tall<br>
But the wood is rotting out, the base is getting thin<br>
And I’m done being the place where you dump all your sin.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
It’s not a quiet flame, it’s a forest fire<br>
I’m burning every bridge, I’m the funeral pyre<br>
You thought I’d stay silent, thought I’d stay small<br>
But I’m the loudest voice inside these four walls!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
So I’m screaming at the walls, I’m screaming at the ghost<br>
Of the man I thought I loved, the one I needed most!<br>
You stripped away my pride and you left me black and blue<br>
Now I’m standing in the wreckage and I’m shouting it at you:<br>
I HATE YOU!<br>
Yeah, I said it, and I mean it tonight<br>
I HATE YOU!<br>
For every time you told me I wasn't right.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
I hate you.<br>
God, I hate you.<br>
Don't look at me.<br>
Just go.<br>
