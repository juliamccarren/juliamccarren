    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    
<p class="text-standard">

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
C major and a cup of lukewarm chamomile tea<br>
That’s how every writing session begins for me<br>
A simple melody, a tale of rain and doubt<br>
Whispered words that never really want to shout<br>
I sit here cross-legged, hair tied back tight and neat<br>
A folksy little stanza that’s bittersweet.<br>
They call me "sensitive," "a poet of the soul"<br>
Trying to fit my story in a tiny, perfect hole.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
But when I strum this vintage six-string, something feels astray<br>
My fingers want to move a different, faster way<br>
I close my eyes and hear a faint, distorted roar<br>
A beat inside my chest that keeps demanding more.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Oh, I thought I was a singer-songwriter, a whisper in the crowd<br>
Barefoot on the stage, never singing too loud.<br>
I thought my truth was found in quiet minor keys<br>
A gentle breeze, rustling through the weeping trees.<br>
But there’s a hum beneath the silence, a low and steady burn…<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
The coffee got cold and the chamomile is gone<br>
I'm hitting chords too hard, staying up until the dawn.<br>
The pen won't write a ballad, it only draws a scream<br>
Of a high-gain amplifier, living out a dream.<br>
I look at the poster of my acoustic hero's face<br>
And realize that I feel utterly out of place.<br>
My boots are scuffed, my shirt has a tear down the side<br>
This 'gentle spirit' persona, I can no longer hide.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
Now I’m not strumming softly, I’m attacking the wood<br>
A frantic, primal rhythm, finally understood.<br>
I open up my throat and let the air escape<br>
This quiet little song is beginning to reshape!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Oh, I thought I was a singer-songwriter, a whisper in the crowd<br>
Barefoot on the stage, never singing too loud.<br>
I thought my truth was found in quiet minor keys<br>
A gentle breeze, rustling through the weeping trees.<br>
BUT THERE'S A HUM BENEATH THE SILENCE, A LOW AND STEADY BURN...<br>
It’s time for this whole quiet, pretty chapter to turn!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
No more apologies, no more holding back the sound!<br>
I'm plugging in the cable right into the ground!<br>
The feedback is singing! The drum kit is a fight!<br>
This isn't a poem, this is pure electric light!<br>
The leather jacket's on, the eyeliner is thick!<br>
This is my real skin, this is my final trick!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro Chorus]</strong><br>
Forget the tea! Forget the rain!<br>
It was always gasoline running through my veins!<br>
I’m not a whisper, I’m a SHOUT!<br>
Let the speakers blow, let the power run out!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Final Chorus/Outro]</strong><br>
I AM A ROCK GIRL! HEAR THE RHYTHM, FEEL THE FIRE!<br>
A THOUSAND WATTS HIGHER!<br>
I AM A ROCK GIRL! PLUGGED IN AND UNDONE!<br>
MY TRUE SONG HAS BEGUN!<br>
