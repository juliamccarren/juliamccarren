<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
Woke up on a Monday, sun in my eyes<br>
Another day in this concrete disguise<br>
Coffee's cold and the rent is due<br>
Got a hole in my jeans and a broken shoe<br>
But there's a hum in my head, a rhythm in my soul<br>
Tonight we'll plug in and lose control<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Three chords, two mics, one beat on the floor<br>
Spilling our guts through the basement door<br>
Amplifier hums and the feedback screams<br>
Chasing down our rock and roll dreams<br>
Sweat and dust and a broken string<br>
Yeah, this is the only song we wanna sing<br>
Just a four-piece band in a rusty old van<br>
Give it all we got, yeah, that's the plan!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
The neighbor's banging on the wall again<br>
Says we're too loud, "When's it gonna end?"<br>
Tell him to chill, we're making some art<br>
Yeah, this is the sound of a beating heart<br>
My fingers are sore and my throat is raw<br>
Against the odds, defying the law<br>
Of boring jobs and a quiet life<br>
We're cutting through it like a rusty knife<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Three chords, two mics, one beat on the floor<br>
Spilling our guts through the basement door<br>
Amplifier hums and the feedback screams<br>
Chasing down our rock and roll dreams<br>
Sweat and dust and a broken string<br>
Yeah, this is the only song we wanna sing<br>
Just a four-piece band in a rusty old van<br>
Give it all we got, yeah, that's the plan!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
Yeah, the club's a dive and the pay is cheap<br>
But the feeling we get is something deep<br>
A little bit of magic, a little bit of noise<br>
For all the girls and all the boys<br>
Who feel like us, who don't fit in<br>
Let's crank it up and let the show begin!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Guitar solo]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Three chords, two mics, one beat on the floor<br>
Spilling our guts through the basement door<br>
Amplifier hums and the feedback screams<br>
Chasing down our rock and roll dreams<br>
Sweat and dust and a broken string<br>
Yeah, this is the only song we wanna sing<br>
Just a four-piece band in a rusty old van<br>
Give it all we got, yeah, that's the plan!<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
Yeah... the plan...<br>
Just the hum...<br>
