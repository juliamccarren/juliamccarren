    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    
<p class="text-standard">

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
You used to hold the door like it was a holy rite,<br>
Tracing circles on my palm in the middle of the night.<br>
You said my eyes were steady stars, your only way back home,<br>
You built a kingdom for us two and put me on the throne.<br>
But lately, you don’t look at me, you’re looking past my shoulder,<br>
The fire that used to keep us warm is turning gray and colder.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Slow it down, baby, can’t you feel the wheels spin?<br>
The ice is getting thinner and the walls are closing in.<br>
You’re losing your grip, you’re letting go of the load,<br>
Watch your step now—we’re on a slippery road.<br>
One wrong move and we’re spinning out of control,<br>
You’re saving your pride but you’re losing my soul.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
The hand that used to find my waist is heavy by your side,<br>
I’m reaching out for anything, but you’ve got nowhere to hide.<br>
You’re picking speed on empty streets, ignoring every sign,<br>
Forgetting how you promised that your heart was tied to mine.<br>
The silence in the driver’s seat is louder than a scream,<br>
You’re drifting out of reach now, like a half-forgotten dream.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Slow it down, baby, can’t you feel the wheels spin?<br>
The ice is getting thinner and the walls are closing in.<br>
You’re losing your grip, you’re letting go of the load,<br>
Watch your step now—we’re on a slippery road.<br>
One wrong move and we’re spinning out of control,<br>
You’re saving your pride but you’re losing my soul.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 3]</strong><br>
I remember when you’d linger just to hear me breathe,<br>
Now you’re looking for a reason or an opening to leave.<br>
You treat my love like gravity—a thing you just expect,<br>
While you pave the way with coldness and a jagged-edged neglect.<br>
The map we drew is freezing over, white-out in the glass,<br>
I’m praying for a salt-truck but I watch the minutes pass.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Guitar solo]</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
The friction’s gone, the traction’s thin,<br>
I don’t know where you end and where the ghosts begin.<br>
You adore the girl I was, but you hate the woman here,<br>
I’m shouting through the windshield, but you’ve closed your inner ear.<br>
It’s a long way down when the pavement turns to glass.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Slow it down, baby, can’t you feel the wheels spin?<br>
The ice is getting thinner and the walls are closing in.<br>
You’re losing your grip, you’re letting go of the load,<br>
Watch your step now—we’re on a slippery road.<br>
One wrong move and we’re spinning out of control,<br>
You’re saving your pride but you’re losing my soul.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
We’re sliding...<br>
You used to worship the ground I walked on.<br>
Now you don’t even see the ice.<br>
Mind the curve, baby.<br>
We’re on a slippery road...<br>
