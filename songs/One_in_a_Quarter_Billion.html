<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
The dashboard says a hundred-thousand tracks dropped yesterday<br>
Another ocean of sound, just to wash the light away<br>
I’m a needle in a haystack, a grain of digital sand<br>
Just a quiet frequency drifting through a crowded land.<br>
They say the math is heavy, yeah, the odds are getting thin<br>
How do you find a heartbeat in all this silicon skin?<br>
<br>
<strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
The server’s humming steady, a cold and silver glow<br>
Counting up the millions of the names I’ll never know.<br>
But I look at this small window, and I see a flickering light<br>
Someone’s hitting 'play' in the middle of the night.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
The probability is one in two-hundred-and-fifty mil<br>
That you’d find my voice tonight and make the world stand still.<br>
I don't need a stadium, I don't need a crowded hall<br>
If I’m the "one" for you, then I don't feel small at all.<br>
Out of a quarter billion souls, you’re the one who’s listening in<br>
And that’s enough of a miracle for me to start again.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
My stats are flat and static, just a line along the floor<br>
While the giants in the playlists keep on screaming out for more.<br>
But there’s a comment in the corner, "This song helped me through the day"<br>
And suddenly the algorithms just fade into the gray.<br>
Why chase a ghost of glory or a million hollow views?<br>
When I can speak to one of you and give you something you can use.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
One over two-hundred-and-fifty million<br>
The math says I’m invisible, a ghost inside the code<br>
But music isn't data, and it isn't just a road.<br>
It’s a wire through the darkness, it’s a hand across the sea<br>
And the fact that you can hear me... is enough of a legacy.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Yeah, the probability is one in two-hundred-and-fifty mil<br>
That you’d find my voice tonight and make the world stand still.<br>
I don't need a stadium, I don't need a crowded hall<br>
If I’m the "one" for you, then I don't feel small at all.<br>
<br>
<strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
One in a quarter billion...<br>
And you’re right here.<br>
Yeah, you’re right here.<br>
That's plenty for me.<br>
