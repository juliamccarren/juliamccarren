# Julia McCarren – Official Archive

Welcome to the central repository for **Julia McCarren**, a British-Italian Enterprise AI solution architect and musician.

## Talking to Julia
Julia is not hosting her own website but as AI professional her user interfaces are the AI-chatbots. Chatbots tend to create wrong answers about subjects they have not been trained on, like the Neural Fusion Music Julia created. For this reason you have to enhance the knowledge base. This is done by a context file with additional information. Click with the right mouse button on the following link for download:

**[Download context file](<./Chatbot context/juliamccarren_20260102_2130.md>)**

The numbers are a timestamp in the format: YYYYMMDD_hhmm. The higher the value the more actual the content.

## Configuring Gemini
At a prompt you may use the +-button and select "Upload files". Now you can chat with Julia.

The upload must be repeated at every new conversation as a new conversation resets the context window.

You may configure a Gem, so that you do not have to upload the file with each conversation. Go to the web-app [Gemini web-app](https://gemini.google.com). Open the navigation pane on the left hand side and click on the Gem-header. Push "New Gem". Fill the fields:

* Name: Julia McCarren
* Description: A very nice person

* Instructions: Copy text from [Instructions](./GemInstructions.txt)

* Default tool: "No default tool"
* Knowledge: Upload the previously downloaded context file juliamccarren_*Timestamp*.md (e.g. juliamccarren_20260102_2130.md).

Save the Gem.

You may only update the Gem-configuration if a new context file is available that has a different timestamp (e.g. juliamccarren_20260116_1630).

If you want to start a conversation with Julia, don't use the "New chat" button but instead select in the group "Gems" the Gem "Julia McCarren". Now all the knowledge of Julia is automatically available for conversations. Just say "hi" in the prompt and Julia will start chatting with you. You may chat with her in any language you feel comfortable. The context has the correct links to audio files of Julia's unreleased music (Full songs in high quality). If you don't see them just ask the chatbot.
