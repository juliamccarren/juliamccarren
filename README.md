# Julia McCarren – Official Archive

Welcome to the central repository for **Julia McCarren**, a British-Italian artist and Enterprise AI solution architect 

## Professional Profile
At her profession in computer science she works as solution architect at enterprise level. She designs complex software architectures including the usage of AI. She created an AI agent that dynamically creates and executes code. This was her personal Skynet moment. She realised that those systems could do extreme harm to humanity especially in critical industries. She engages in installing guardrails for human control and respecting ethics in the evolution of the AI landscape.

## 🎵 Artistic Profile
At the age of 15 Julia became a certified semiprofessional church organist playing services and concerts. She sings in a choir and played the synth in her school band. Her repertoire is Bach and the virtuoso pieces of Widor and Boëllmann.

## Neural Fusion Music
Out of curiosity and combining her profiles she stepped into the field of AI assisted music creation in 2024. The results were not satisfactory. She paused until summer 2025. This time the output was quite impressive. She build up a research project on AI assisted music that included both the reengeneering of the deployment pipeline as the economic consequences of the new era of music production. The goal was to create music that is at least at the same level of quality as present top artists. She creates the lyrics out of her inspirations driven by personal experiences to retain authenticity. She challenges the generators with difficult styles to create like rock and fusions of different genres.

Julia combines her background as a semiprofessional organist with her expertise in IT development to create a unique sound known as **Neural Fusion Sound**.

**"Elevate music creation"**
