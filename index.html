        <h2>Professional Profile</h2>
        <p class="text-standard">At her profession in computer science she works as solution architect at enterprise level. She designs complex software architectures including the usage of AI. She created an AI agent that dynamically creates and executes code. This was her personal Skynet moment. She realised that those systems could do extreme harm to humanity especially in critical industries. She engages in installing guardrails for human control and respecting ethics in the evolution of the AI landscape.</p>
